# NestJS Dependency Injection and CRUD Example

## Description
This project demonstrates a clean implementation of Dependency Injection (DI) and service-repository architecture using NestJS. It provides a simple CRUD API for managing products.

## Setup Instructions
```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```
Open [http://localhost:4000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs) for Swagger UI.

## Features
- Full NestJS architecture with Dependency Injection - DI
- In-memory data persistence (runtime only)
- Proper use of services and repositories
- DTO validation with `class-validator`
- Auto-generated Swagger docs

## Improvements With More Time
- Integrate persistent storage (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Add authentication/authorization
- Add pagination and filtering
- Use real unit tests with mocks
